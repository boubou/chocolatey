    <description>What is Audio Switcher?
Audio Switcher is a 100% free, and Open Source application for Windows® Vista, 7, and 8.

Audio Switcher makes switching between sound devices trivial. No longer do you have to go into Control Panel or the Windows® Sound options, instead there is an easy to access icon, or even hotkeys.

The beautiful part of Audio Switcher is it's simplicity. It doesn't try to do too much, it does exactly what is needed; nothing more, nothing less.

Audio Switcher is developed by @xenolightning, entirely in my spare time. Continued development is spurred on by the users, if you have any feedback, feel free to contact me.</description>
