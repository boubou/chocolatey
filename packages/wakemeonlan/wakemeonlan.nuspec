    <summary>Turn on computers on your network with Wake-on-LAN packet</summary>
    <description>
This utility allows you to easily turn on one or more computers remotely by sending Wake-on-LAN (WOL) packet to the remote computers.

When your computers are turned on,  WakeMeOnLan allows you to scan your network, and collect the MAC addresses of all your computers, and save the computers list into a file.

Later, when your computers are turned off or in standby mode, you can use the stored computers list to easily choose the computer you want to turn on, and then turn on all these computers with a single click.

WakeMeOnLan also allows you to turn on a computer from command-line, by specifying the computer name, IP address, or the MAC address of the remote network card.

    <releaseNotes>
	Version 1.86
Updated the internal MAC addresses database.
Version 1.85
Updated the internal MAC addresses database.
Version 1.84
Fixed bug: WakeMeOnLan failed to remember the last size/position of the main window if it was not located in the primary monitor.
Updated the internal MAC addresses database.
Version 1.83
Updated the internal MAC addresses database.
Version 1.82
Removed the 'Use Broadcast Address According to IP Address' menu item, which was inactive since version 1.70
Version 1.81
Added new option to 'Send The Wake-on-LAN Packet To...': 'Name of the device'. If you choose this option - For every computer you wakeup, WakeMeOnLan will try to resolve the name of the computer/device ('Computer Name' column) to IP address and then send the wakup packet to this IP address. If the name cannot be resolved, the IP address displayed in the 'IP Address' column will be used.
Version 1.80
When using the combination of /scan and one of the save command-line option ( /scomma, /shtml , and so on....) the 'Status' field is now updated according to scan result.
e.g: WakeMeOnLan.exe /scan /shtml c:\temp\status.html
Fixed bug: On some systems, WakeMeOnLan failed to detect correctly the active network adapter for scanning.
Version 1.79
Updated the internal MAC addresses database.
Added 64-bit version.
Version 1.78
The connect name is now displayed in the network adapters list. ('Advanced Options' window)
Version 1.77
Updated the internal MAC addresses database.
Version 1.76
The default of 'Send The Wake-on-LAN Packet To...' option is now 'Broadcast Address According to IP Address' instead of 'Broadcast Address 255.255.255.255'. This change is made because on some Windows 10/8 systems, the 'Broadcast Address 255.255.255.255' option doesn't work.
Version 1.75
Added /wakeupmulti command-line option, which allows you to wake up multiple computers, for example:
/wakeupmulti 192.168.0.25 192.168.0.31 192.168.0.35
Version 1.73
Added the 'Start Scanning - Only Selected IPs' option to the right-click context menu.
Updated the internal MAC addresses database.
Version 1.72
Added 'Start Scanning - Only Selected IPs' option.
Version 1.71
Updated the internal MAC addresses database.
Version 1.70
Added 'Send The Wake-on-LAN To...' option (Under the Options menu): Broadcast Address 255.255.255.255 (The default), Broadcast Address According to IP Address, or IP Address of the device.
Fixed issue: On some systems, WakeMeOnLan added items with 00-00-00-00-00-00 as MAC address.
Version 1.68
Added 'Copy As Hosts File' option. (Ctrl+H)
Version 1.67
Added 'Scan Listed IPs On Start' option.
Version 1.66
Fixed bug: WakeMeOnLan failed to sort the computers list properly on start.
Added 'Index' column, which represents the order that the computers were added.
Version 1.65
Added option to scan only the IP addresses listed in the main window of WakeMeOnLan. ('Start Scanning - Only Listed IPs' - Ctrl+F5)
Version 1.62
You can now specify host name as the broadcast address.
Version 1.61
Added new option to 'Change Wake Up Settings of Selected Items' window: 'Send multiple Wake-on-LAN packets'.
Version 1.60
Added 'Change Wake Up Settings of Selected Items' option, which allows you to assign for every item the port number and the broadcast address that will be used instead of the default port number/broadcast address. You can select multiple items and then change the port number and broadcast address for all selected items at once.
Version 1.55
Added /cfg command-line option, which instructs WakeMeOnLan to use a config file in another location instead if the default config file, for example:
WakeMeOnLan.exe /cfg "%AppData%\WakeMeOnLan.cfg"
Version 1.53
Updated the internal MAC addresses database.
Version 1.52
Added 'Auto Size Columns+Headers' option.
Added option to choose the font displayed on the main window of WakeMeOnLan.
Version 1.51
When you choose to scan specific IP addresses range, WakeMeOnLan now automatically skips the broadcast addresses, according to the IP addresses/Subnet masks settings of every network adapter.
The default button of the delete question-box is 'No', in order to avoid from deleting by mistake.
Version 1.50
Added 'Use Broadcast Address According to IP Address' option. When it's turn on, the broadcast address is calculated according to the IP address. For Example, if the IP address is 192.168.0.10, then 192.168.0.255 will be used as broadcast address.
Fixed bug: WakeMeOnLan failed to load the external MAC addresses file (oui.txt) when every line has 2 leading space characters. (Sometimes this file is provided with leading space characters, I don't really know why...)
Version 1.48
Updated the internal MAC addresses database.
Version 1.47
Fixed issue: The properties dialog-box and other windows opened in the wrong monitor, on multi-monitors system.
Added 'Mark Odd/Even Rows' option, under the View menu. When it's turned on, the odd and even rows are displayed in different color, to make it easier to read a single line.
Version 1.46
Fixed /wakeup command-line option to accept MAC Address in xxxxxxxxxxxx format, when the computer is not in the list.
Version 1.45
Added new command-line options: /UseIPAddressesRange , /IPAddressFrom , /IPAddressTo , and more...
Version 1.41
Added /wakeupiprange command-line option, which allows you to wake up computers in the specified IP addresses range.
Version 1.40
Fixed bug: For some computers the workgroup name displayed instead of the computer name, if the NetBIOS scan was turned on.
Added Workgroup column (This column is filled only if the NetBIOS scan is turned on)
Version 1.37
Fixed bug: WakeMeOnLan crashed on some systems when starting the scanning and the 'Clear ARP Cache On Every Scan' option is turned on.
Version 1.36
Added 'Clear ARP Cache On Every Scan' option. This option is useful for Windows 2000/XP, because if the ARP cache is not cleared, a device might be displayed as connected even when it's not connected, because the ARP information is taken from the cache of Windows operating system. On Windows Vista/7, this option is irrelevant, because the ARP scanning is not affected by the cache.
Version 1.35
Added 'Add New Computer' option (Ctrl+N), which allows you to manually add new computer to the list.
Added 'Edit Selected Computer' option (Ctrl+E), which allows you to edit the selected computer entry.
Version 1.30
Added new option (In Advanced Options window): Use NetBIOS protocol to locate computers on other network segments. By default, WakeMeOnLan uses only ARP protocol to detect computers on your network. If this option is turned on, WakeMeOnLan also scans your network with NetBIOS protocol. As opposed to ARP, NetBIOS scan can also detect computers located on other network segments.
Version 1.28
Added 'Ask Before Wake Up' option. By default, this option is turned on. If you turn it off, the 'Wake Up Selected Computers' option will work immediately, without asking any question.
Version 1.27
Added 'Start As Hidden' option. When this option and 'Put Icon On Tray' option are turned on, the main window of WakeMeOnLan will be invisible on start.
Version 1.26
the /wakeup command-line option now accepts MAC addresses in xxxxxxxxxxxx format.
Version 1.25
Added 'MAC Address Format' option, under the Options menu.
Copy MAC Address option now allows you to copy multiple MAC addresses.
Version 1.21
Fixed bug: When using the 'Scan the following IP addresses range' option, WakeMeOnLan didn't scan the last IP address in the specified IP range.
Version 1.20
Added 'Put Icon On Tray' option.
Version 1.15
Added /wakeupall command-line option, which allows to easily wake up all computers in the list from command-line.
Version 1.12
Fixed the sorting of the IP Address column.
Version 1.11
Added /scan command-line option, which automatically scans your network and update the .cfg file without displaying any user interface.
Version 1.10
Added 'Advanced Wake Up' (F7), which allows you to specify 2 advanced parameters for waking up your remote computers: Port Number and Broadcast Address.
Also, added the option to specify the port number and broadcast address from command-line.
Version 1.00 - First release.
