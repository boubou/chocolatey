	<releaseNotes># Changelog
-All notable changes to the current version are documented in this file.

3.0.2.1 - 2019-08-24

Added
- Added a link to NoMoreRansom.org, in the "Malware Removal" tab.
   
Changed
- The "Email where you wish to receive the log", in the "Settings" tab, is now a saved setting. This means that it will not be deleted after a program restart, 
and that it will also be exported when you use the "Backup" functionality, or when you upgrade Windows Repair Toolbox using the built-in functionality.

- Centered the "Update All" settings and the "Set password" window in relation to the Windows Repair Toolbox main window and not in relation to the screen.

Fixed
- If new tools where introduced in a new version of Windows Repair Toolbox, after upgrading to that new version (using the built-in upgrade mechanism), 
the "Update All" settings would not save the settings regarding those new tools.

- It was possible to open more than one "Update All" settings window at the same time.
